# Raster data

GeoTIFF (.tif/.tiff) : Industry standard raster format with embedded geospatial metadata and coordinate reference system information

JPEG2000 (.jp2) : Advanced compression format supporting both lossless and lossy compression with built-in geospatial capabilities

PNG (.png) : Lossless compression format with transparency support, ideal for classification results and discrete data visualization

JPEG (.jpg) : Widely compatible compressed format suitable for visual inspection and quick result sharing

BMP (.bmp) : Uncompressed bitmap format with simple structure, resulting in large file sizes but maximum compatibility

TIFF (.tiff) : Flexible raster format without geospatial tags, supporting multiple layers and high-quality storage

NetCDF (.nc) : Scientific data format designed for multidimensional arrays and time-series remote sensing data

HDF5 (.h5) : High-performance hierarchical data format optimized for large datasets and complex analytics storage

PDF (.pdf) : Portable document format preserving layout and quality, ideal for report generation and result documentation


# Vector data:

**Most Common Vector Formats:**

1. **Shapefile (.shp)** : ESRI's widely supported format for points, lines, polygons with attribute data

2. **GeoJSON (.geojson)** : Lightweight, web-friendly JSON-based format for geospatial features

3. **KML/KMZ (.kml/.kmz)** : Google Earth format for geographic visualization and sharing

4. **GPKG (.gpkg)** : Modern SQLite-based format supporting both raster and vector data

5. **DXF (.dxf)** : AutoCAD format for CAD and GIS data exchange

**Most Professional:** Shapefile and GeoPackage
